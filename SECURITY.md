# Security Policy & Procedures

## 🔒 Security Setup

This project uses multiple layers of security scanning and monitoring to ensure dependencies are secure and up-to-date.

### Current Security Status
✅ **Snyk Monitoring**: Active  
✅ **Production Dependencies**: Zero vulnerabilities  
✅ **Development Dependencies**: 2 moderate (non-critical)  
✅ **Firebase**: Updated to v11.10.0 (latest)  
✅ **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Actions + Snyk  

## 🛡️ Security Tools & Commands

### Manual Security Checks
```bash
# Run full security audit
npm run security:audit

# Test for vulnerabilities only
npm run security:test

# Update dependencies and test
npm run security:fix

# Update monitoring snapshot
npm run security:monitor
```

### Automated Security
- **GitHub Actions**: Runs on every push/PR + weekly schedule
- **Snyk Monitoring**: Email notifications for new vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Review**: Blocks PRs with vulnerable dependencies

## 🚨 Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels
- **Critical/High**: Immediate action required
- **Medium**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low**: Fix during next maintenance cycle

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automatic notification via email/GitHub
2. **Assessment**: Review vulnerability details
3. **Fix**: Update dependency or apply patch
4. **Verify**: Run `npm run security:test`
5. **Deploy**: Push fix to production

## 📊 Security Dashboard

**Snyk Dashboard**: https://app.snyk.io/org/jkv-sudo/project/...

Monitor your project's security status, view vulnerability history, and manage policies.

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Setup

To enable automatic security scanning:

1. **Add Snyk Token**: Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. **Create secret**: `SNYK_TOKEN` with your Snyk API token
3. **Get token**: https://app.snyk.io/account (Account Settings → API Token)

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm run security:audit`
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies up to date

### Regular Maintenance (Monthly)
- [ ] Update dependencies: `npm update`
- [ ] Run security scan: `npm run security:test`
- [ ] Review Snyk dashboard
- [ ] Check for Firebase updates

### Emergency Response
- [ ] Identify vulnerable dependency
- [ ] Check impact on application
- [ ] Update to safe version
- [ ] Test application functionality
- [ ] Deploy fix immediately

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regular updates prevent accumulation of vulnerabilities
2. **Monitor Continuously**: Snyk monitoring catches new vulnerabilities quickly
3. **Test Before Deploy**: Always run security tests before production deployments
4. **Review Dependencies**: Understand what packages you're using
5. **Use Semantic Versioning**: Pin major versions, allow patch updates

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
- **Email**: [Your security contact]
- **Encrypted**: Use GPG if available
- **Response Time**: 24-48 hours

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Development Dependencies (Non-Critical)
- **esbuild <=0.24.2**: Moderate vulnerability in development server
- **vite**: Depends on vulnerable esbuild
- **Impact**: Only affects development server, not production build
- **Status**: Monitored, fix requires breaking changes (Vite v7)
- **Mitigation**: Production builds are not affected
